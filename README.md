# Smack! Android
This is the Android application component of the larger Smack! project (website will be available soon). The Smack! project seeks to aid the lives of students at the University of Minnesota, as well as businesses, clubs, and other organizations by creating a platform for students to see food-related promotions. This will include free food, discounted food, and limited offers. 

This is advantageous to the food providers because it will be a visible, accessible platform to advertise events and promotions. To the students, free/discounted food is always a plus, and this is a chance to get students engaged in local clubs and events. It's a win-win!
